Nexthammer Lumen api - a corpus backend
=================================

Just as [nexthammer_react](https://github.com/tunicorpora/nexthammer_react),
this is a project in its very early stages. The goal is to provide a RESTful
api for a corpus interface providing such functionality as concordancing,
collocations, n-grams, retrieving of lexically relevant data etc. An emphasis
will be on multilingual parallel and comparable corpora as the source data.
